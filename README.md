# Price_Converter

#I created this script to convert the cost with more than 2 decimal digits to 2 decimal digits and includes the price unit it took to convert (ie. 12.3456 is converted to 1234.56 and include 100 as price unit)
#This conversion tool eliminates manual conversion of costs and the need to calculate the price unit it took to convert
